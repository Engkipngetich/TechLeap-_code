1. Large or Unoptimized Images

Cause:
Images that are too large, in the wrong format, or not compressed increase page load time.
#Fix:
Compress and resize images using tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or use modern formats like WebP.
Implement lazy loading so that images load only when they appear in the user’s viewport.
Use responsive image tags (<picture> or srcset) to serve different image sizes for different devices.

2. Too Many or Heavy JavaScript and CSS Files

Cause:
Multiple external scripts and style sheets block rendering and delay content display.
#Fix:
Minify and bundle JS and CSS files to reduce file size and HTTP requests.
Use asynchronous (async) or deferred (defer) script loading so they don’t block HTML rendering.
Remove unused code or libraries (known as code splitting and tree shaking).

3. Slow Server Response or Lack of Caching

Cause:
Slow backend performance, unoptimized database queries, or no caching system in place.

#Fix:
Enable browser caching (store static resources locally on the client).
Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to serve files from locations closer to the user.
Optimize server performance (e.g., enable Gzip/Brotli compression, improve database indexing, or upgrade hosting).

#other optimazations ways:
Use lazy loading for videos and iframes.
Reduce HTTP requests by combining assets.
Use performance monitoring tools like Google Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, or GTmetrix to identify and fix bottlenecks.
